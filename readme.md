# Getup
A very minimal CSS framework, consisting of:

* Normalize
* Some useful default SASS variables
* A range of utility classes and placeholders such as `%clearfix` and `%visuallyhidden`
* A simple grid system (based on Twitter Bootstrap)

## Getting Started

### Installation with Bower
Add the the following to your `bower.json` dependencies section:

```
"getup": "git@github.com:clubstudioltd/getup.git#~3.1.0"
```

Run `bower install` and be sure to import the source files into your projects CSS. e.g.

```
@import 'vendor/bower_components/getup/src/sass/getup';
```

Thatâ€™s it. You should now have access to the helper classes, mixins and functions that Getup provides.
